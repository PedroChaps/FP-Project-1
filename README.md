# FP - First Project

The first project of the FP class (Foundations of Programming).

The goal of the project was to create a Human vs. Computer Tic-Tac-Toe game.
You can play the game via the command line.

The project was written in Python and explored the basics concepts of the language and programming in general.

# How to run

To run the project, run `python3 -i Projeto1.py` and call the function `jogo_do_galo(*player*, *difficulty*)`, where `player` is either `"X"` or `"O"` and `difficulty` is either `"basico"`, `"normal"` or `"perfeito"` (basic, normal and perfect, respectively).
